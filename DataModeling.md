# Data Modeling: Embedding vs Referencing

In MongoDB, there are two common methods for modeling data: **Embedding** and **Referencing**. Both have their own pros and cons, and choosing the right one depends on the specific needs of your application. Below is a detailed comparison to help you understand each approach.

---

## **1. Embedding**

Embedding stores related data directly within a single document. This method works well when data is frequently retrieved together, and data consistency is important.

### **Pros:**
- **Faster Reading**: All related data is stored together, so no additional queries are required to fetch related data.
- **Single Query Updates**: Updating all data in one place is possible with a single query.
- **Less Expensive Lookup**: No need for additional lookups to retrieve data.

### **Cons:**
- **Slow Writing and Updating**: Writing or updating large documents can be slow since the entire document must be rewritten.
- **Limited Size**: Documents are capped at 16MB in size, which can limit the amount of embedded data.
- **Data Duplication**: If the same data appears in multiple documents, there may be unnecessary duplication.

## **2. Referencing**

Referencing stores only the IDs (usually `ObjectIds`) of related documents within a document, pointing to other collections. This method works well when data grows independently and is frequently updated.

### **Pros:**
- **Fast Writing and Updating**: Writing and updating documents is fast as only references need to be updated, not the entire document.
- **No Data Duplication**: Data is stored once, reducing redundancy.
- **Scalable**: Works well for large data sets as there are no size limitations for individual documents.

### **Cons:**
- **Slow Reading**: Requires additional queries to look up and fetch referenced data, which can impact performance.
- **Expensive Lookup**: Lookups to retrieve related data can be more expensive as they require separate queries.
- **Complex Queries**: More complex queries and joins may be needed to fetch related data.

## **Comparison Table**

| **Aspect**            | **Embedding**                                         | **Referencing**                                        |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**         | Storing related data directly within a document.      | Storing a reference (e.g., `ObjectId`) to another document. |
| **Faster Reading**     | Yes, because all related data is stored together.     | No, requires additional queries to fetch referenced data. |
| **Writing Performance**| Slow for large data, as the whole document needs to be rewritten. | Fast, as only references are updated.                   |
| **Update Performance** | Slow for complex updates since the entire document must be updated. | Fast, only the reference is updated.                   |
| **Size Limitations**   | Limited to 16MB per document.                        | No size limit, data can grow indefinitely.              |
| **Data Duplication**   | Possible data duplication if data is repeated across multiple documents. | Avoids data duplication by storing only references.     |
| **Scalability**        | Limited scalability due to document size limits.     | High scalability, as data is normalized and stored separately. |
| **Query Performance**  | Less expensive, as no additional lookups are required. | More expensive, requires multiple queries to fetch related data. |
| **Lookup**             | No lookup needed since data is embedded directly in the document. | Requires lookup to retrieve data from the referenced document. |
| **Use Case**           | Best for smaller, self-contained data or when fast access is needed. | Best for larger, frequently updated data or when data needs to be shared between multiple documents. |

## **Conclusion**

Both **embedding** and **referencing** have their advantages, and the choice between them depends on your application's needs:

- **Embedding** is suitable for:
  - **Faster reading** and **simpler use cases**.
  - Small to medium-sized data.
  
- **Referencing** is ideal for:
  - **Scalable, large applications**.
  - Frequent updates and shared data.

## **Data Relationships in ER Diagram**

### **1. One-to-One (1:1) Relationship**

- Each entity has **only one** related entity.
- **Example**: One **person** has one **passport**.
  - One **student** has one **profile**.

In an **ER diagram**, this means for each **student**, there is exactly one **profile** linked to them, and each **profile** belongs to one **student**.

### **2. One-to-Many (1:M) Relationship**

- One entity can have **many** related entities.
- **Example**: One **teacher** can have many **students**.
  - One **admin** can manage many **faculty members**.

In an **ER diagram**, this means one **teacher** can be linked to many **students**, but each **student** has only one **teacher**. Similarly, one **admin** manages many **faculty members**, but each **faculty member** is managed by only one **admin**.
