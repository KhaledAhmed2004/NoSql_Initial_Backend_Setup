# `validateRequest` middleware

```typescript
import { NextFunction, Request, Response } from "express";
import { AnyZodObject } from "zod";
import catchAsync from "../utils/catchAsync";

// Middleware to validate request data using Zod schema
const validateRequest = (schema: AnyZodObject) => {
  return catchAsync(async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    // Validate body and cookies against the schema
    await schema.parseAsync({
      body: req.body,
      cookies: req.cookies,
    });

    // Proceed to the next middleware
    next();
  });
};

export default validateRequest;
```

This code defines a middleware function for an Express application that uses the **Zod** library to validate incoming requests. Let's break it down step by step:

---

### **1. What is this middleware for?**
- This middleware ensures that the incoming request's body and cookies match the rules defined in a **Zod schema**.
- It prevents invalid data from proceeding to the application's core logic, improving robustness and security.

---

### **2. Key Components**
#### **a. Dependencies:**
- **`Request`, `Response`, `NextFunction`**: These are standard Express objects used in middleware.
  - `Request` holds the request data.
  - `Response` is used to send data back to the client.
  - `NextFunction` is a callback to move to the next middleware or route handler.
- **`AnyZodObject`**: This is a type from Zod that ensures the schema is a valid Zod schema.
- **`catchAsync`**: A utility function that wraps asynchronous functions to handle errors automatically.

#### **b. `validateRequest` Function:**
- Accepts a **Zod schema** as an argument.
- Returns an Express middleware function.

#### **c. `schema.parseAsync`:**
- Validates the `req.body` and `req.cookies` against the schema rules.
- If validation fails, Zod throws an error, and the `catchAsync` utility handles it (likely sending an error response to the client).

#### **d. `next()` Function:**
- If the data is valid, the `next()` function is called to proceed to the next middleware or route handler.

---

### **3. How Does It Work?**
1. **Receive the Request:**
   - The middleware gets executed for incoming HTTP requests.
2. **Validate Data:**
   - The `schema.parseAsync` method checks whether the `req.body` and `req.cookies` conform to the provided Zod schema.
3. **Error Handling:**
   - If validation fails, the error is caught by `catchAsync`, which likely sends a response with the error details.
4. **Proceed on Success:**
   - If validation passes, `next()` is called, moving to the next middleware or route handler.

---

### **4. Example Use Case**
Suppose you have a route where users must send their name and email in the request body. You can define a schema with Zod and validate it like this:

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";
import validateRequest from "./middlewares/validateRequest";

// Define a Zod schema
const userSchema = z.object({
  body: z.object({
    name: z.string().min(1, "Name is required"),
    email: z.string().email("Invalid email address"),
  }),
});

// Route handler
app.post(
  "/register",
  validateRequest(userSchema),
  (req, res) => {
    res.send("User registered successfully!");
  }
);
```

1. If the `name` or `email` is missing/invalid, the middleware stops the request and sends an error.
2. If the data is valid, the request proceeds to the route handler.

---

### **5. Why Use This Middleware?**
- **Centralized Validation**: Keeps validation logic consistent and reusable.
- **Clean Code**: Separates validation from business logic.
- **Error Handling**: Automatically catches validation errors using `catchAsync`.
- **Scalability**: Easy to apply different schemas to different routes.
