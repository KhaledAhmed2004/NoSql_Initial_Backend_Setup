we need to create er digramTo help visualize and understand the relationships and data referencing ammabeding.

after data modaling then we need to create api endPoinst . here is a exppme:

## **API Endpoints Example**

Below are examples of RESTful API endpoints for the **Student** entity:

### **Student Routes**:
1. **GET /students** - Fetch all students
2. **GET /students/:id** - Fetch student details by ID
3. **POST /students** - Create a new student
4. **PUT /students/:id** - Update a student's profile by ID
5. **DELETE /students/:id** - Delete a student by ID

---

### **API Example for Other Entities**

#### **Faculty Routes**:
1. **GET /faculty** - Fetch all faculty members
2. **GET /faculty/:id** - Fetch faculty details by ID
3. **POST /faculty** - Create a new faculty member
4. **PUT /faculty/:id** - Update faculty profile by ID
5. **DELETE /faculty/:id** - Delete a faculty member by ID

#### **Admin Routes**:
1. **GET /admins** - Fetch all admins
2. **GET /admins/:id** - Fetch admin details by ID
3. **POST /admins** - Create a new admin
4. **PUT /admins/:id** - Update admin profile by ID
